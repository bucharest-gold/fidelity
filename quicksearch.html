"},"index.html":{"id":"index.html","title":"Index","body":" Documentation Classes FidelityPromise Fidelity A fast and simple Promise/A+ implementation capable of Node.js or browser-based execution. Fidelity adheres to both the Promise/A+ specspecification, and the ES6 Promise API in its entirety. Project Info License: MIT Build: make Documentation: http://bucharest-gold.github.io/fidelity/ Issue tracker: https://github.com/bucharest-gold/fidelity/issues Engines: Node.js 4.x, 5.x, 6.x InstallationFidelity can be used in Node.js. $ npm install fidelityOr in the browser. &lt;!-- load fidelity --&gt; &lt;script src=&quot;fidelity-promise-min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;When used in the browser, a FidelityPromise object is created in the global scope. UsageA fidelity promise behaves according to the Promises/A+ specification. If you haven't read it, it's worth your time and will probably make all of the fidelity documentation clearer. You can create promises using the exported constructor. const Fidelity = require('fidelity'); new Fidelity( (resolve, reject) =&gt; { // etc. } )You call the constructor function with an executor function as the only parameter. Typically this function will perform some asynchronous task, and when that task has completed it will resolve or reject the promise depending on whether or not the task completed successfully. The executor function takes two function parameters: resolve and reject. These functions are used to resolve or reject the promise as needed. Suppose we have a function, someAsyncFunction() that takes some time to complete asynchronously. We can call this function using a promise. const Fidelity = require('fidelity'); new Fidelity( (resolve, reject) =&gt; { someAsyncFunction((result, err) =&gt; { if (err) { reject(err); // The function produced an error. Reject the promise } else { resolve(result); // Fulfill the promise with the result } }); }) .then( (val) =&gt; { // This code executes after a promise has been fulfilled // Do something with the result. }) .catch( (err) =&gt; { // This code executes if the promise was rejected });Promise statesA promise will only ever be in one of three states. Fidelity.PENDING, Fidelity.FULFILLED or Fidelity.REJECTED. APIGenerated documentation can be found here: http://bucharest-gold.github.io/fidelity. FidelityThe fidelity module exports a constructor function for a Fidelity promise. const Fidelity = require('fidelity');new Fidelity(func)A constructor function that creates and returns a promise. The func parameter is a function that accepts a resolve and reject function. Fidelity#then(onFulfilled, onRejected)The 'then' function takes two function arguments. The first, onFulfilled, is called with the return value (if any) of the promise function if it is successfully fulfilled. The second function, onRejected is called in the event of an error. A promise is returned in either case. p.then( (result) =&gt; { console.log('sucessful result ', result); }, (err) =&gt; { console.error('whoops!', err); });Fidelity#catch(onRejected)This is just a little syntactic sugar for promise.then(null, onRejected);. It returns a promise. Fidelity.resolve(value)A static utility function that returns a promise which has been resolved with the provided value. Fidelity.reject(reason)A static utility function that returns a promise which has been rejected with the provided reason. See: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/reject Fidelity.all(iterable)A static utility function which returns a promise that resolves when all of the promises in the iterable argument have resolved, or rejects with the reason of the first passed promise that rejects. See: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/all Fidelity.race(iterable)A static utility function which returns a promise that resolves or rejects as soon as one of the promises in the iterable resolves or rejects, with the value or reason from that promise. See: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/race Fidelity.deferred() A static utility function that Creates and returns a deferred object. Deferred objects contain a promise which may be resolved or rejected at some point in the future. An example. const deferred = Fidelity.deferred(); callSomeAsyncFunction((err, result) =&gt; { if (err) { deferred.reject(err); } else { deferred.resolve(result); } });Fidelity.deferred().resolve(value) Resolves the deferred promise with value. Fidelity.deferred().reject(cause)Rejects the deferred promise with cause. Fidelity.deferred().promiseThe deferred promise. TestingThis module passes all of the tests in the Promises/A+ Compliance Test Suite. To run the full suite of the Promises/A+ spec, just npm test from the command line. BenchmarksIt's pretty fast. Benchmarks are notoriously a lot like statistics so take this with a grain of salt. Results from a simplified, non-scientific benchmark performed on a Macbook Pro on a random Friday afternoon.

"},"FidelityPromise.html":{"id":"FidelityPromise.html","title":"Class: FidelityPromise","body":" Documentation Classes FidelityPromise Class: FidelityPromise FidelityPromise Represents the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. new FidelityPromise(fn) Creates a new FidelityPromise. Parameters: Name Type Description fn function The executor function. It is executed immediately, and should accept two resolver functions, 'resolve' and 'reject'. Calling them either fulfills or rejects the promise, respectively. Typically, the executor function will initiate some asynchronous task, and the call 'resolve' with the result, or 'reject' if there was an error.
